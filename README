DESCRIPTION
    This class provides a widget that immitates a segmented LED or LCD
    display. It shows a single character by lighting or shading fixed
    rectangular bars.

    The default style pen is used as the widget pen, though only the
    background colour will actually matter as the widget does not directly
    display text.

    The following style keys are used:

    lit => COLOUR
    unlit => COLOUR
        Colour descriptions (index or name) for the lit and unlight segments
        of the display.
